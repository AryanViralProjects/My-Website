                <p class="milestone-narrative">
                    When I was in 10th grade, my dad asked me to help with his business. Being a rebellious kid, I refused. Then I discovered our business was struggling, and I realised my dad needed me more than the business itself. I started learning performance marketing to bring our businesses online. After months of learning and practice, I helped our family business establish an online presence and managed over $50,000 in advertising spend.

                    My marketing expertise expanded beyond family business, evolving into freelance work managing $200,000+ in advertising campaigns. Sensing there was more to explore, I took a gap year and discovered e-commerce—a perfect match for my skills. This journey introduced me to "entrepreneurship" ;)

                <p class="milestone-narrative">
                    Faced with the choice between formal business education and hands-on experience, I chose the latter, leaving college to focus on my e-commerce venture. This decision proved transformative—within nine months, the business grew from zero to $120,000 in revenue. Additionally, I launched a startup with a six-person team and got into the first cohort of a prestigious business school's entrepreneurship program.
